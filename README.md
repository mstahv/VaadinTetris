#Vaadin Tetris

This is the source code for a Vaadin based Tetris game. It was originally presented during a talk by Sami Ekblad in "Vaadin and HTML5" in JavaDay Riga, November 2011.

The code has since been slightly modified to use the official Vaadin Push (in version 7.1) and new Valo theme and some build in icons.

The Tetris game engine tries to follow the guidelines given at  http://tetris.wikia.com/
